# TikTok Data Analysis Project

## Introduction üìã
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify TikTok videos as claims or opinions based on various engagement metrics. The goal is to improve content moderation and ensure compliance with TikTok's terms of service by accurately identifying videos that are more likely to make claims.

## Problem Statement üò©
Accurately classifying TikTok videos as claims or opinions is crucial for moderating content and ensuring compliance with the platform's terms of service. This classification helps prioritize videos for review and prevents the spread of misinformation.

## Dataset üî¢
### Data Sources
The dataset consists of TikTok video metadata, including view counts, like counts, share counts, and more. The data is sourced from TikTok's internal databases and includes both verified and unverified accounts.

### Data Dictionary
- `video_id`: Unique identifier for each video
- `video_duration_sec`: Duration of the video in seconds
- `video_transcription_text`: Text transcription of the video
- `verified_status`: Whether the author is verified or not
- `author_ban_status`: Author's ban status
- `video_view_count`: Number of views
- `video_like_count`: Number of likes
- `video_share_count`: Number of shares
- `video_download_count`: Number of downloads
- `video_comment_count`: Number of comments

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputed missing values in columns like `video_view_count`, `video_like_count`, etc.
- **Data Type Conversions**: Ensured correct data types for each column.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features such as `likes_per_view`, `comments_per_view`, and `shares_per_view`.

## Methodology üõ†Ô∏è
### Data Collection and Loading
The data was loaded into a Pandas dataframe for analysis. Initial exploration was conducted to understand the size, shape, and composition of the dataset.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Inspected the data for missing values and outliers.
- Cleaned and transformed the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

## Exploratory Data Analysis üîç
- **Initial Data Exploration**: Used `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()` to understand the dataset.
- **Visualizations**: Created histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize distributions and relationships.
- **Insights**: Identified trends and patterns, such as higher engagement levels for claim videos.

## Feature Engineering üîß
- **Transformed Features**: Applied log transformation to skewed features.
- **Selected Important Features**: Based on EDA, selected features like `video_view_count`, `video_like_count`, and `video_share_count`.

## Model Development üî©
### Model Selection
Tested various models including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. Selected models based on their performance metrics.

### Model Evaluation
- **Random Forest**: 
  - Precision: 69%
  - Recall: 66%
  - F1-score: 66%
- **XGBoost**: 
  - Precision: 70%
  - Recall: 68%
  - F1-score: 68%
- **Logistic Regression**: 
  - Precision: 65%
  - Recall: 62%
  - F1-score: 63%

### Model Interpretation
- **Feature Importance**: Key features influencing the predictions included `video_view_count`, `video_like_count`, and `video_share_count`.
- **Behavioral Insights**: Longer videos and higher engagement metrics were strongly associated with claim videos, indicating that such videos are more likely to contain claims.

## Results and Insights üìä
- **Summary of Findings**: Claim videos tend to have higher engagement metrics compared to opinion videos.
- **Actionable Insights**: Prioritize high-engagement videos for review to improve content moderation efficiency.

## Conclusion üí°
- **Recap**: The project successfully developed a model to classify TikTok videos as claims or opinions, aiding in content moderation.
- **Recommendations**: Further refine the model with additional data and features, and deploy the model in a production environment for real-time classification.

## Future Work üß≠
- **Extend the Model**: Incorporate new data and features to enhance model accuracy.
- **Fine-tune the Model**: Continuously retrain the model with new data.
- **Enhance the UI**: Improve the user interface for better accessibility and usability.

## Appendices üìë
### Queries or Code
- Detailed code and queries used in the analysis are provided in the accompanying Jupyter Notebooks and scripts.

### Additional Charts and Tables
- Additional visualizations and tables supporting the findings are included in the project documentation.
