# TikTok Truth Serum: Classifying Content on TikTok

## Project Overview üìã
This project develops a **machine learning model** to classify TikTok videos as either **claims** or **opinions** based on engagement metrics. The goal is to improve content moderation and ensure compliance with TikTok's terms of service by identifying videos likely to contain claims, which may need prioritized review. This work is part of the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone Project**.

## Problem Statement üò©
Accurately classifying TikTok videos as claims or opinions is essential for moderating content and ensuring compliance with platform guidelines. This classification prioritizes videos for review, reducing the spread of misinformation.

## Dataset üî¢
The dataset includes TikTok video metadata such as:
- **Identifiers**: `video_id` (unique video identifier)
- **Content Features**: `video_duration_sec`, `video_transcription_text`, `verified_status` (author‚Äôs verification status)
- **Engagement Metrics**: `video_view_count`, `video_like_count`, `video_share_count`, `video_download_count`, `video_comment_count`

### Data Preparation
- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputed missing values in key columns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features like `likes_per_view` and `shares_per_view` to enrich the data.

## Methodology üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Data Exploration**: Used exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, including summary statistics and visualizations, to understand distributions and relationships.
2. **Feature Transformation**: Applied log transformations to skewed features. Selected important features (`video_view_count`, `video_like_count`, `video_share_count`) based on EDA findings.
3. **Model Selection and Evaluation**: Tested three models ‚Äî **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Logistic Regression** ‚Äî using metrics like **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**, and **Accuracy**.

### Model Interpretation
- **Feature Importance**: Key features influencing predictions included `video_view_count`, `video_like_count`, and `video_share_count`.
- **Behavioral Insights**: Longer videos and higher engagement metrics were strongly associated with claim videos, suggesting that these videos are more likely to contain claims.

## Model Performance üî©
- **Random Forest**: Precision 69%, Recall 66%, F1-score 66%
- **XGBoost**: Precision 70%, Recall 68%, F1-score 68%
- **Logistic Regression**: Precision 68%, Recall 53%, F1-score 61%, Accuracy 67%

## Results and Insights üìä
- **Summary of Findings**: Claim videos tend to have higher engagement metrics compared to opinion videos.
- **Engagement Trends**: Videos with higher view counts and engagement metrics are more likely to be classified as claims.
- **Actionable Insights**: Prioritize high-engagement videos for review to improve content moderation efficiency. Implementing this model can help streamline the moderation process on the platform.

## Conclusion üí°
- **Recap**: The project successfully developed a model to classify TikTok videos as claims or opinions, supporting content moderation.
- **Recommendations**: Further refine the model with additional data and features, and deploy it in a production environment for real-time classification.

## Next Steps üîú
1. **Model Extension**: Incorporate additional data sources and features to enhance accuracy.
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Regularly evaluate and update the model to ensure sustained effectiveness.
3. **User Training**: Equip moderation teams with training to effectively leverage the classification system.

## Appendices üìë
- **Code and Queries**: The complete code and queries are provided in the accompanying Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Additional Visualizations**: Supplementary charts and tables supporting findings are included in the project documentation.
### Additional Charts and Tables
- Additional visualizations and tables supporting the findings are included in the project documentation.
